### Maven, SQL, JDBC

- Our first look into one half of the full stack. Connecting a Java application to a database. We'll be using a Java/SQL integration library called JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity), which will require a "maven dependency". Maven is a dependency manager and build tool that will help us create more powerful apps. From now on, most apps we make will be Maven projects.
